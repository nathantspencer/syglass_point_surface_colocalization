# PENDING ISSUE
The plugin does not currently work on meshes that have been transformed using the 'Transform Surfaces Only' function. 
This branch has been created to preserve the work that has been started to add the capability to the existing plugin.
The branch of the main syGlass repository that this work relies on is the [get-mesh-transform](https://github.com/IstoVisio/syGlass/tree/get-mesh-transform) branch.
## syglass_point_surface_colocalization
Python plugin for colocalizing counting points and surfaces.
